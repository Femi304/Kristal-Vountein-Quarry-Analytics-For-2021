# Kristal-Vountein-Quarry-Analytics-For-2021
The Kristal Fountain Quarry 2021 Dashboard provides operational insights, showcasing total operating costs, annual revenue by material type, average operating hours, fuel consumption, and production volume. This analysis was completed using Power BI to deliver detailed, actionable insights.

Observations

1. Operating Hours: The average operating hours are quite high at 16.06 hours, suggesting extensive use of equipment.
2. Safety Incidents by Satisfaction: Satisfaction levels seem linked to safety incidents. Low satisfaction corresponds with the highest incident rate (39.62%), while high satisfaction has the lowest incident rate (28%).
3. Production by Material: Basalt has the highest production volume (33 million tons), while Sandstone has the lowest (22 million tons).
4. Operating Costs by Equipment: Excavators have the highest operating cost ($3.8 million), while Loaders have the lowest ($3.1 million). This suggests excavators might be more expensive to maintain or operate.
5. Annual Revenue by Material: Granite generated the highest annual revenue ($607 million), whereas Sandstone generated the lowest ($404 million).
6. Revenue by Quarry: Quarry 14 is the top revenue generator ($161 million)
7. Fuel Consumption by Equipment: Excavators consume the most fuel (764,000 liters), while Loaders consume the least (552,000 liters).
8. Total Metrics:
Annual Revenue: $3 billion.
Total Operating Cost: $14 million.
Total Production Volume: 522,000 tonnes.
 

Recommendations

1. Safety and Satisfaction Improvement:
A. Since low satisfaction is associated with a higher rate of incidents, consider implementing worker welfare and engagement programs to boost satisfaction, which may reduce incidents.
B. Offer safety training or incentives for high safety standards, especially in quarries or areas with low satisfaction.

2. Optimize Equipment Use and Maintenance:
A. Investigate the high operating and fuel costs associated with excavators. Explore options to optimize excavator usage or improve fuel efficiency.
B. Schedule regular maintenance and check for alternative equipment or operational practices that may reduce operating costs.

3. Revenue Maximization for Sandstone:
A. Since Sandstone generates the lowest revenue, analyze potential improvements, such as marketing strategies or cost efficiencies, to enhance its profitability.
B. Consider whether increasing sandstone production or adding value-added processes could boost its revenue potential.

4. Boost Low-Performing Quarries:
A. Assess the factors contributing to low performing performance. Consider reallocating resources or adjusting operational strategies to improve its output and profitability.

5 Fuel Management:
A. Given the high fuel consumption, evaluate fuel efficiency strategies, especially for excavators. Adopting energy-efficient practices or equipment upgrades may reduce fuel costs and environmental impact.
Monitor and Control Operating Hours:
With high average operating hours, track equipment wears and ensure that maintenance schedules prevent costly breakdowns. Reducing hours without compromising productivity could lead to long-term cost savings.
